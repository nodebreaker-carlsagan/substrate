# Substrate Prometheus Exporter

## Introduction

Prometheus is one of the most widely used monitoring tool for managing highly available services supported by [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/). By providing Prometheus metrics in Substrate, node operators can easily adopt widely used display/alert tools such as Grafana and Alertmanager without setting-up/operating external Prometheus push gateways (which is an antipattern in the first place) through RPC connections. Easy access to such monitoring tools will benefit parachain developers/operators and validators to have much higher availability of their services.

## Metrics

Substrate can report and serve the Prometheus metrics, which in turn can be consumed by Prometheus collector(s). Metrics will be served under /metrics on 9615 port by default.

## Start Prometheus
### Install prometheus

https://prometheus.io/download/
```bash
wget <download URL>
tar -zxvf <prometheus tar file>
```

### Edit Prometheus config file

You can visit [prometheus.yml](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/documentation/examples/prometheus.yml) to download default `prometheus.yml`.

Then edit `prometheus.yml` and add `jobs` :

```yaml
      - job_name: kusama
          static_configs:
          - targets: ['localhost:33333']
            labels:
              instance: local-validator
```

> Noteï¼švalue of targets is ip:port which used by substrate monitor 

### Start Prometheus

```bash
cd <prometheus folder>
./prometheus
```

> The above example, you can save `prometheus.yml` at `~/volumes/prometheus` on your host machine

You can visit `http://localhost:9090` to see prometheus data.



## Start Grafana
### Install Grafana
https://grafana.com/docs/installation/debian/

```bash
apt-get install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"
wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install grafana
sudo service grafana-server start
./prometheus
```

You can visit `http://localhost:3000/` to open grafana and create your own dashboard.

> Tips: The default username and password are both admin. We strongly recommend immediately changing your username & password after login

### Seting Grafana
